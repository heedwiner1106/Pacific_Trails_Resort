    <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
            <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off
                the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls,
                a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.
            </dd>
        <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down
                quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience 
                includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water.
                Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

        <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
            <dd>
                Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. 
                It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
